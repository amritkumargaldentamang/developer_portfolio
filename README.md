Quick verification
 - Open `index.html`, `about.html`, `portfolio.html`, and `contact.html` in a browser (double-click or serve with a local server).
 - Test keyboard navigation: press `Tab` to reach the "Skip to main content" link, press Enter — focus should move to the main content.
 - On small screens (or by resizing window to <768px) the `☰ Menu` button should toggle the navigation.
 - Toggle theme using the theme button — confirm `aria-pressed` updates (use browser devtools/Elements panel).
 - On the Contact page, submit the form with invalid/empty values to see client-side validation messages.

Local server (optional)
```
# Python 3 (from project root)
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

This is my personal portfolio consisting of works and projects I have developed during my academic days.
